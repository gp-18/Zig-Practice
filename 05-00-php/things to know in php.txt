1) outputs in php 
echo 
print
print_r()
var_dump()
var_export()

1 a) single line php in html <? = "hello_parth" ; ?>

2) data type and varible
- String - A string is a series of characters surrounded by quotes
- Integer - Whole numbers
- Float - Decimal numbers
- Boolean - true or false
- Array - An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value
- Object - A class
- NULL - Empty variable
- Resource - A special variable that holds a resource

/* --------- Variable Rules --------- */

- Variables must be prefixed with $
- Variables must start with a letter or the underscore character
- variables can't start with a number
- Variables can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variables are case-sensitive ($name and $NAME are two different variables)

2 a ) const in php =  define('HOST' , 'ANY_NAME'); 
      echo HOST ;

3 ) arrays => 2 ways to create array
a) associatve array => we can create our own index and value to it just like key value pair
b) multidimensional array 
c) decode from json

4) operators ,if else , if else if else  , ternary operator and switch statement

5) for loops , while loops , do while loops for each loops 

6) functions 
   variable functions 
   arrow functions

7) inbuilt arrrays functions 	
   count 

   add at last 
   add at beginning 
   add at last another way 
	
   remove from last 
   remove from start 
   remove at particular index 

   chunk of the array 

   concate of the array 

   combine array (key & value ) 

   keys of the array 
	
   flip the keys and values 
 	
   range 
 
   map 

   filter 

8) inbuilt functions used in strings 
   
    find the position of first occ 
    find the position of last occ 
    reverse the string 
    convert the string to lower case 
    convert the string to upper case 
    string replace 
    return the spefic part 
    string start with 
    string ends with 
    role of printf

9) superglobals 
   Built in variables that are always available in all scopes
   $GLOBALS - A superglobal variable that holds information about any variables in global    scope.
  $_GET - Contains information about variables passed through a URL or a form.
  $_POST -  Contains information about variables passed through a form.
  $_COOKIE - Contains information about variables passed through a cookie.
  $_SESSION - Contains information about variables passed through a session.
  $_SERVER - Contains information about the server environment.
  $_ENV - Contains information about the environment variables.
  $_FILES -  Contains information about files uploaded to the script.
  $_REQUEST - Contains information about variables passed through the form or URL.

10) get and post in form 

11) Filter Input => they are used so that the script cannot run on the chrome . when script run on the chrome it create problem so to overcome that we use filter_input(INPUT_GET/POST , nameOfVariable , FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS/EMAIL/NUMS);

12) cookies => SETCOOKIE('value' , 'value acc to it ' , time() + 86400(this is the time for one day ) ) ; => when you want to unset then SETCOOKIE('value' , '(pass empty string here)',time() + 86400 ) ; 

13) session (doubt) 

14) file handling 
    $handle = fopen(file name , 'mode of operation' ) ;
    $contents = fread($handle , filesize($file)) ; 
    fclose($handle) ; 
    echo $contents ; 

15) file upload (doubt) 
    when you are using file upload in html form use enctype in form because without using    that the file upload will not work 

16) error exception try catch and finally 

17) oops concept class object oop 4 pillar
